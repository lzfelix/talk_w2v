# word2vec showcase

I used this code to showcase a few concrete simple applications of word2vec on a talk about this subject. Notice that all examples are in Portuguese.

The demo depends on Python 3.x, if you want to run just the word2vec part, then ensure that you have `gensim` installed. If you want to run the chat-bot demo part, then use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To download the 100-dimensional word vectors trained in Portuguese, use `./get_wordvectors_pt.sh` (thanks no NILC/USP).
